# CSE326 Project

## 📘 Project Overview
The **CSE326 Project** is a web application built using modern web development technologies. It integrates a responsive front-end using **Svelte** with a back-end supported by **PostgreSQL** for database management. The project follows a modular design, ensuring clear separation of concerns, and aims to showcase best practices in web development, database integration, and TypeScript usage.

## 🚀 Features
- **Modern Front-End**: Built with **Svelte** for fast, reactive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript Support**: Ensures type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **Database Integration**: Uses **PostgreSQL** with PLpgSQL scripts for managing database logic.
- **Vite Build System**: Modern, fast development environment using **Vite**.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design for seamless use on different devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Front-End**: Svelte (for reactive UI components)
- **Back-End**: PostgreSQL (database) with PLpgSQL scripts
- **Build Tools**: Vite (for fast development and build)
- **Language**: TypeScript (for static typing and code quality)

## 🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed before running the project:
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) and npm/yarn (for package management)
- **PostgreSQL** (for database integration)
